# Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms (GA) are a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). GA are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
